# Data Structure

## What is a data structure?

A data structure is a method for organizing and storing data in computers. It represents a collection of data values, the relationships between those values and the operations or functions they can deliver. Computer programmers use data structures to pass data to other components of an application or to a completely new application. The four primary functions of data structures are inputting, processing, maintaining and retrieving data.

## Array

### Introduction

An array is an arrangement of numbers, pictures or objects formatted into rows and columns according to their type. In coding and programming, an array is a collection of items, or data, stored in contiguous memory locations, also known as database systems. The purpose of an array is to <span style="background-color:yellow">**store multiple pieces of data of the same type together.**</span> You can use an array to demonstrate a mathematical property known as the commutative property of multiplication, which illustrates that you <span style="background-color:yellow">**can change the order**</span> of the factors or elements, and the product of the elements remains the same.<br>

In computer programming, an array can help you locate and identify where you stored each piece of data, or element, by adding an offset to each value. An offset is a number that represents the difference between the two indexes. Similar to an index in a book, an index in computer programming contains a record of entries with the names of the data items and their locations. Thus, you can <span style="background-color:yellow">**identify each element and its location by referring to the index within the array.**</span>

### What is an array's size?

An arrayâ€™s size can be crucial in programming. Software developers and computer programmers use coding programming language, or C language, in a lot of their work, and arrays contain a <span style="background-color:yellow">**fixed-size amount of elements in C language.**</span> This means you're unable to expand or shrink an array because once you declare its elements, the software statistically allocates a designated amount of space for it.<br>

This is because if you create an array by directly initializing its values, the size of the array will be the exact number of elements you enter into it. If you remove or add an element, you're required to create a new array and enter the exact number of elements in your dataset.

### What are the types of arrays?

#### One-dimensional arrays

A one-dimensional array, also called a single-dimensional array, involves assessing the elements in sequential order, making it a linear array. You can assess this array according to the subscript of either a row or column index. In coding and programming, a subscript is a number or symbol programmers use to identify an element with an array.<br>

A one-dimensional array is a list of variables of similar data types and allows you to assess all the elements by referring to their index. In a one-dimensional array, you can represent several data items as a list.

#### Multidimensional arrays

Multidimensional arrays include two-dimensional and three-dimensional assemblages that you can use to implement matrices and various data structures. While one-dimensional arrays store a single list of elements, multidimensional arrays store lists-of-lists. They can represent multiple data items as a table with various rows and columns.

### What are the advantages and disadvantages of using arrays?

#### Advantages of using arrays

- **Managing memory**: Because an array sorts various variables under a single name, arrays offer a <span style="background-color:yellow">**more efficient memory management strategy.**</span> The program could create a new variable for each element entered, but then items would be more difficult and time-consuming to locate, so search engines often use arrays to store and sort data.
- **Providing a single name for multiple variables**: A software designer may find it challenging to organize multiple variables without using a specific tool like an array. Arrays help maintain large sets of data under a single variable name to avoid confusion that can occur when using several variables.
- **Performing matrix operations**: Small and large databases may use one-dimensional or two-dimensional arrays to perform matrix operations. Some of these operations include addition and multiplication.
- **Implementing other data structures**: Programmers and software developers can use arrays to implement other data structures, including queues, heaps, stacks and hash tables.

#### Disadvantages of using arrays

- **Inflexible data values**: Because of the fixed and static sizing of arrays, the software requires you to create an additional array to alter the size of your dataset rather than adding to or subtracting from the one you've created. This can make your work more time-consuming, but you can avoid this by reviewing your data before creating an array.
- **Insertion and deletion challenges**: In addition to the fixed size of arrays, they also may present challenges with inserting or deleting data values. Because arrays store elements in consecutive memory features, deleting values and inserting new ones can be challenging, but you can avoid this issue by taking your time and carefully planning your data entries.
