### Context API
Context API is an exciting addition to the world of React. It offers a convenient way to share data across multiple components without the need to manually pass props at each level. This feature is particularly helpful when you have data that needs to be accessed globally within a tree of React Components. such as theme preferences or preferred language.

One of the main benefits of Context API is its ability to simplify state management in your application. By using Context, you can reduce the complexity of passing data between components and eliminate the need for additional actions or props. This can make your code more concise and easier to maintain. It’s like having a handy tool that streamlines the sharing of data among your components. <br>
